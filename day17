//Question 49: Function with Rest Parameters: Write a function that takes a rest parameter representing multiple hobbies. It should log each hobby with a statement saying you enjoy that hobby.

// Defines a function that accepts multiple hobbies as arguments
function logHobbies(...hobbies: string[]) {
    // Loops through each hobby in the array
    hobbies.forEach(hobby => {
        // Logs a statement for an each hobby
        console.log(`I enjoy ${hobby}.`);
    });
}

// Calls the function with three hobbies
// logHobbies("reading", "writing", "coding");

//Question 50: Multiline Template Literals: Use template literals to create a multiline string that describes your ideal day. Include at least three different activities.

let myActivites = 
`Today I listened one podcast.', '
I wrote about how I spent a day today', 
'I recite a Quran Kareem`;

console.log(myActivites);

//Question 51: Refactoring to Arrow Functions: Take a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle and refactor it into an arrow function.

// Original function for calculating the area of a rectangle
function calculateArea(width: number, height: number): number {
    return width * height;
}

// Refactored into an arrow function
let calculateAreaArrow = (width: number, height: number): number => width * height;

// Example usage of the arrow function
console.log(calculateAreaArrow(5, 7)); // Logs the area of the rectangle
