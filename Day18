//Question 52: Make a Smartphone Object: Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. Include its brand, model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of its screen, and how long its battery lasts.

let smartPhone = {
    brand: 'Redmi',
    model: '13c',
    storage: '128GB',
    screensize: 6.74,
    batteryLasts: '2 days'
}

console.log(smartPhone);

//Question 53: Pulling Apart a Nested Object: Imagine you have a list inside another list that shows what a computer programmer knows, like coding languages, tools, and software frameworks. Find a way to get three specific skills from this list and show them.

// A list showing a programmer's skills in detail
let programmerSkills = {
    languages: ["TypeScript", "NextJS", "Python"],
    frameworks: ["React", "Angular", "Vue"],
    tools: ["Git", "Webpack", "Docker"]
};

// // Getting specific skills from the list
let { languages, frameworks, tools } = programmerSkills;

// // Showing a skill from each category
console.log(`Language: ${languages[0]}, Framework: ${frameworks[0]}, Tool: ${tools[0]}`);

//Question 54: Making Flexible Object Keys: Learn how to set up a list where you can change the name of each section based on what you need at that moment, like adjusting labels based on user choices.

type DynamicObject = {
    [key: string]: string;
};

function createObjectWithDynamicKey(key: string, value: string) {
    // Initialize dynamicObject with the defined type
    let dynamicObject: DynamicObject = {};
    // Setting up a section in the list with a changeable name
    dynamicObject[key] = value;
    return dynamicObject;
}
// Using the flexible list setup for a user's preference
let userPreference = createObjectWithDynamicKey("theme", "dark");
console.log(userPreference);
